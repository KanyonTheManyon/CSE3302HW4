Programming Assignment 04

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Demonstrate once again elementary understanding of Regular
    Expressions and how to use them in the useful languages, C and
    C++.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * The example input file will have multiple proposed tokens on
    each line.  There also might be lines with no proposed tokens
    and / or just or extra whitespace.

  * The proposed tokens will be separated by whitespace, which is
    to be ignored.

  * Your program will consider successive tokens from the input
    file and classify them as 'GeePea', 'Shake', 'Orc', or
    'does not match'.

	 "^[0-9a-fA-F]+[(][}][aeiouAEIOU]+$";

  * An GeePea is an even number of exclamation points '!' or
    question marks '?' followed by one or more 'g' or 'P' letters
    followed by 'PEA' if it was only 'P' letters, 'gee' if
    it was only 'g' letters, and nothing else if it was a mixture
    of both.

	GeePea =((!|?)%2==0)(g|P)(PEA if only P and no g)(gee if only 'g' letters)(nothing else if mix of P and g))
		    "^([!|?][!|?])*[[g+gee]|[P+PEA]|[g|P)+] ]"

    (FYI:  "an even number" means 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ..., which
     can also be stated as 2n, where n >= 0.)

  * A Shake is a left parenthesis '(' or a vertical bar '|' or a
    minus sign '-' followed by an odd number of letters 'M'
    through 'W' followed by a left parenthesis '(' or a vertical
    bar '|' or a minus sign '-' BUT IT CANNOT END WITH THE SAME
    CHARACTER WITH WHICH IT STARTED.  That is, if it begins with
    '(', it must end with '|' or '-', and so forth.

    (FYI:  "an odd number" means 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or ..., which
     can also be stated as 2n+1, where n >= 0.)

	Shake = ['(' or '|' or '-'][[M-W]%2==1]['(' or '|' or '-']CANNOT END WITH STARTING CHAR
		   ['('][M-W][M-WM-W]*['|' or '-']  ['|'][M-W][M-WM-W]*['(' or '-'] | ['-'][M-W][M-WM-W]*['|' | '('] 

  * An Orc is an ampersand '&' followed by zero or more letters
    'a' through 'm' or 'N' through 'Z', followed by an question
    mark '?' when the all of the letters are uppercase, a plus
    sign '+' when all of the letters are lowercase, or an asterisk
    '*' when there are no letters at all.  Mixing lowercase and
    uppercase letters is not allowed.

	Orc = ('&')('a-mN-Z')*('?' IF ALL LETTERS UPPERCASE)('+' IF ALL LETTERS LOWERCASE)('*' IF NO LETTERS AT ALL)(NO MIXING OF UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE)
		['&'][['a-m'+'+'] | ['N-Z'+'?'] | '*']

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples:

  !??!ggee        -- legal GeePea
  !!PPPPEA        -- legal GeePea
  ??!!gPgP        -- legal GeePea

  !PPEA           -- illegal GeePea, not even number of !, ? marks.
  !!PPPgee        -- illegal GeePea, should have been PEA at end
  !?!?PgPgPgPEA   -- illegal GeePea, should have had no PEA at end

  (M|             -- legal Shake
  |WMW-           -- legal Shake
  -MWMWM(         -- legal Shake

  (M(             -- illegal Shake, begins and ends with same character
  |WMWM-          -- illegal Shake, even number of letters
  -MwMwM(         -- illegal Shake, not all uppercase letters

  &ZYXPON?        -- legal Orc
  &abcklm+        -- legal Orc
  &*              -- legal Orc

  PONZYX?         -- illegal Orc, no & at front
  &mackle*        -- illegal Orc, should be + at end
  &OPeNdOOR*      -- illegal Orc, can't mix lowercase and uppercase

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download HMWK_04_dalioba.zip from Canvas.

  2. Unzip the file somewhere convenient.

  3. Change 'dalioba' in the name of the directory to your NetID.
     (Your NetID is three letters followed by four or five digits.
      The directory name will now be something like
      'hmwk_04_abc1234', with YOUR NetID instead of 'abc1234'.)

  4. Look in that directory.

  5. Change the header lines in the skeleton files
     hmwk_04.c / .cc :

      -- Line 1:  Family name first, then a comma, then
                  personal name.

      -- Line 2:  Your NetID.

      -- Line 3:  The date you edited the file in the format
                  YYYY-MM-DD.

     These must remain the first three lines of each file.

  6. Run the files you just changed with the provided
     'inputdata.text' as the input file.

  7. Observe the following output (it will be the same no matter
     which language you picked):

processing tokens from inputdata.txt ...
>!??!ggee< is the proposed token.
>!!PPPPEA< is the proposed token.
>??!!gPgP< is the proposed token.
>!PPEA< is the proposed token.
>!!PPPPPgee< is the proposed token.
>!?!?PgPgPgPEA< is the proposed token.
>(M|< is the proposed token.
>|WMW-< is the proposed token.
>-MWMWM(< is the proposed token.
>(M(< is the proposed token.
>|WMWM-< is the proposed token.
>-MwMwM(< is the proposed token.
>&ZYXPON?< is the proposed token.
>&abcklm+< is the proposed token.
>&*< is the proposed token.
>PONZYX?< is the proposed token.
>&mackle?< is the proposed token.
>&OPeNdOOR*< is the proposed token.

  8. Now, change the contents of processToken() function in each
     of the hmwk_04.c and .cc files to use the regular expression
     support of the corresponding language so that the following
     output is generated for the 'inputdata.txt' test case file.

processing tokens from inputdata.txt ...
>!??!ggee< matches GeePea.
>!!PPPPEA< matches GeePea.
>??!!gPgP< matches GeePea.
>!PPEA< does not match.
>!!PPPPPgee< does not match.
>!?!?PgPgPgPEA< does not match.
>(M|< matches Shake.
>|WMW-< matches Shake.
>-MWMWM(< matches Shake.
>(M(< does not match.
>|WMWM-< does not match.
>-MwMwM(< does not match.
>&ZYXPON?< matches Orc.
>&abcklm+< matches Orc.
>&*< matches Orc.
>PONZYX?< does not match.
>&mackle?< does not match.
>&OPeNdOOR*< does not match.

  9. You should get the same output for each of the two languages.
     Make your output match this format EXACTLY since when your
     solutions are tested, their output will be checked using
     diff.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Make a zipfile of your 'hmwk_04_abc1234' directory (where
'abc1234' is replaced with YOUR NetID) and submit it on Canvas
as your results for this assignment.  Your submission should be a
zipfile that has exactly one item in it, a directory named
'hmwk_04_abc1234' (where 'abc1234' is YOUR NetID).  Inside that
directory should be two source files, hmwk_04.c and hmwk_04.cc.

Your submission will be run on another file of test data.
That file will have 24 possible tokens and your solutions will
score 1/2 point for each token that generates the correct message.

Therefore, the maximum possible score for this homework assignment
is 24 points (12 + 12).

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:
  1. Ensure your programs compile and run correctly.  Not
     compiling or not generating the correct output will cost you
     points.

     Ensure your output messages match the format shown above when
     you change the processToken() function.  The output is going
     to be checked by a program, so it has to match EXACTLY.

     After you write your programs, use diff or fc to compare
     your output to the supplied 'outputdata.txt'.  It must match
     EXACTLY or you will be penalized points.

     ('EXACTLY' means character-by-character the same.  No, e.g.,
      differences in spacing, no changes in wording, no changes
      in punctuation, no changes in capitalization, and so forth.
      Check your output against the 'outputdata.txt' file!)

  2. Ensure that you update the three header lines at the top of
     each of the source files with YOUR name (family name first,
     then a comma, then your personal name), YOUR NetID, and the
     date you edit the file (in the format YYYY-MM-DD).

     Not updating the header lines properly or moving them from
     being the first three line will cost you points.

  3. DO NOT change anything in the main() routine in the C++ case.
     You might want to put some initialization code at the top of
     the main() routine in the C case (depending on how you do the
     processing) but DO NOT change anything else in that routine.

     Your programs will be tested from the command line on
     different input files, so do not change the command line
     argument processing.  If your programs do not run correctly
     when run from the command line and supplying the input file
     name as an argument, you will score ZERO points.

  4. You might use some lines of static code aside from changing
     the contents of processToken().  (This will depend on how you
     decide to do the regular expressions.)

  5. Ensure you use the regular expression support of the
     language.  Programs that do not do all of their matching
     using the regular expression support of the corresponding
     language will score ZERO points.

  6. These programs are not complex.  The processToken() routine
     in the C reference solution is 12 lines of code.  There are
     three additional lines of static data and 12 lines of
     initialization code at the beginning of the C main function.

     For C++, the processToken() routine is 15 lines of code,
     including three lines of static declarations.

     If you find yourself writing lots more code than this in
     either the C or C++ case, you're probably going down the
     wrong path.

  7. After you write your regular expressions, make up some test
     cases of your own to ensure that your REs really match the
     descriptions given above.  The test cases in 'inputdata.txt'
     are useful, but they are NOT comprehensive.  Make up some
     more of your own.

  8. Ensure your submission to Canvas is packaged EXACTLY as
     described above.

      -- Your submission should be a ZIP FILE (not a tar, rar, gz,
         or any other kind of compressed file).

      -- The zip file should be named 'hmwk_04_abc1234.zip' (with
         'abc1234' replaced with YOUR NetID).

      -- This zip file should have ONE item in it, a directory
         named 'hmwk_04_abc1234'  (with 'abc1234' replaced with
         YOUR NetID).

      -- Your source files should be in that directory.  The
         source files should be named hmwk_04.c / .cc.

     Submissions in the wrong format score ZERO points.

  9. After you submit your zip file on Canvas, download it from
     Canvas and check that your submission is in the proper
     format, that the programs run and print the correct output,
     and that you updated the header lines correctly in each of
     the source files.

 10. Are you CERTAIN you complied with all of these nit-picking
     instructions?  Really?  Maybe you ought to check just one
     more time. :)
